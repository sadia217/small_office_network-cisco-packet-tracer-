# small_office_network-cisco-packet-tracer-
This project is on small office network and I have implemented this project in packet tracer.

 Here I have created three different sectors:
Administration, User panel and Employee department.
For implementing this project I have used 4 routers, 14 switches,
almost 61 pcs and 6 different C class network address and on 
administration session there are one DNS server and one web server 
containing the details of employees.
I have used both static and DHCP for configuring the end devices.
I have used static in the VLAN side and DHCP in administration as 
well as users panel.
Also static the DNS and web server so that they don’t change their IP
automatically.
I have used RIP routing protocol version 2 in our project.
Because It's a standardized protocol and provides fast convergence.
And in the right session I have applied VLAN.
I have created three separate departments. IT, HR and sale.
IT and HR are connected in same switch and situated in same floor.
On other hand sale and IT are connected in same switch and situated 
in same floor.
Only 1st floor’s IT department and 2nd floor’s IT department can 
communicate with each other.
But the other department cannot communicate for security purpose.
I haven’t use NAT, because Network Address Translation that’s 
mean NAT consumes the processor and memory because NAT 
need to translate IPv4 addresses for all incoming and outgoing IPv4 
datagram and to keep the translation details in memory. It slows 
down the network performance; therefore it creates a problem in real time protocols.

Thank you.
